1.  Create a script that, when run, will display the following environment variables to the console:
USER
HOME
HISTCONTROL
TERM
Ans:
#! /bin/bash
Printenv  USER
Printenv Home
Printenv  TERM
Printenv  HISTROCONTROL
 
2. 2 Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT
Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.
Ans: 
#!/bin/sh
MYUSERNAME=$USER
MYPASSWORD='password'
STARTOFSCRIPT=`date`
ENDOFSCRIPT=`date`
echo 'username is ' $MYUSERNAME
echo 'password is ' $MYPASSWORD
echo 'Start time '  $STARTOFSCRIPT
echo 'End time '    $ENDOFSCRIPT

3. Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run. Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, using inline comments, what each command is doing.
Ans:
#! bin/bash
echo " creating two variables"
MYUSERNAME="archana"
MY_MESSAGE="Hello world"
echo "first variable is: $MYUSERNAME"
echo "second variable is: $MY_MESSAGE"
 
4. Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.
Ans:

#! /bin/bash

echo "Echo a full sentence to the terminal"
echo "Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null"
