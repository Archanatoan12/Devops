1.  Create a script that, when run, will display the following environment variables to the console:
USER
HOME
HISTCONTROL
TERM
Ans:
#! /bin/bash
Printenv  USER
Printenv Home
Printenv  TERM
Printenv  HISTROCONTROL
 
2. 2 Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT
Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.
Ans: 
#!/bin/sh
MYUSERNAME=$USER
MYPASSWORD='password'
STARTOFSCRIPT=`date`
ENDOFSCRIPT=`date`
echo 'username is ' $MYUSERNAME
echo 'password is ' $MYPASSWORD
echo 'Start time '  $STARTOFSCRIPT
echo 'End time '    $ENDOFSCRIPT
